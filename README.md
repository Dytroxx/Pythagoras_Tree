# Pythagoras_Tree
I had the task to draw an interactive Pythagoras tree, which could be changed via the user interface. 
The following code is the result of this project. 
The following code is a recursive approach to draw the Pythagorean tree. 

##Qt Gui

The interface was designed to dynamically adapt to any changes. So with every action the change of the tree is shown directly, because with every setting the update() is called.
